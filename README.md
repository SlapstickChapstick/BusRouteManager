# BusRouteManager
Built in Python, it uses PyODBC to talk to a local MS Access Database.

This project has served as a learning tool for me to get an understanding of database manipulation using Python alongside SQL.
It has a full user login system and a route manager.

# Scenario:

A local bus company currently keeps records on paper. They are looking into making everything digital, making the whole process more efficient. You have been employed to build this system as well as a program capable of interacting with the records held. The program must be easy to navigate and feature a user login system to add extra security.

# Features

 - An MS Access Database (Who'd have thought??).
 - PyODBC (SQL Library in Python).
 - A login system, complete with user creation/deletion.
 - A fully working Route Management System.

# YOU WILL NEED THE MS ACCESS DRIVER IN ORDER TO RUN THIS
